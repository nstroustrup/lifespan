This repository contains v2 of the lifespan machine software, comprised of

1. Scanner control software ( *ns_image_server* ) for the distributed high-throughput microscope system first described in Stroustrup et al. "The C. elegans Lifespan Machine". Nature Methods 2013
2. Image analysis software ( *ns_image_server* ) that extracts survival data from lifespan machine data sets
3. Visualization software ( *ns_worm_browser* ) for inspecting and annotating images and automated analysis.

**Major Revisions**

2020.08.29: version 2.5 is finished and merged into the v2 branch.  This update adds feature-complete support for the new hidden markov model (HMM) posture analysis models, upgrades to the worm browser UI, and many bugfixes.

2019.08.01: version 2.3 is finished and merged into the v2 branch.  This update contains major user interface performance improvements in the worm browser, performance upgrades, and many bugfixes. 

2018.08.01: version 2 is declared stable

2017.08.02: version 2 beta is ready for testing

2013.2.24: First commit to github

2006.10.17: Start of project
